# CaseStudy

## Overview

#### Problem
Using the API available at http://svc.metrotransit.org/, create a program that will allow a user to see how long until the next bus/train on a route will leave a specified stop. This can be completed by using any language of your choice. 

#### Solution
In this example, I have chosen to create a PowerShell module that can be used to explore tha API freely and utilize a specific function that will provide the answer requested in the problem.
